# Overview

The reSIProcate repository contains the following C++ libraries and applications:
* resip library: comprehensive (RFC3261) SIP stack
* dum (Dialog Usage Manager) library: high level SIP library for creating SIP user agents (no media stack)
* recon library: high level SIP UA library with media stack integration
* rePro application: SIP Proxy server
* reTurn application: STUN/TURN server
* MOHParkServer appplication: a SIP based Music-on-hold server using recon
* reConServer application: a SIP based B2BUA server with media using recon
* reTurn library: STUN/TURN client library
* tfm library: a SIP based SIP framework

# CMake Instructions

## Building on *nix Systems

To create an in-tree build:
Navigate to git root folder where top level CMakeLists.txt file is
```
$ cmake .
$ make
```

To create an _out of tree_ build:
```
$ mkdir cmake_build # Or any other name
$ cd cmake_build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Once this is built, you can run the unit tests with:
```
$ ctest
```
or, for verbose output:
```
$ ctest -V
```

If you want to start fresh either delete the out of tree build directory or
delete the CMakeCache.txt file.

### Tips
* Some linux packages can be hard to track down.  If you don't need the features that enabling these packages provides you can disable them in the build.  One such package is QPID Proton.
```
$ cmake -DBUILD_QPID_PROTON=OFF .
```

### Required Packages For Default Enabled CMake Settings
* git
* make
* cmake
* clang or g++ (resip CI uses clang-13, lld-13, g++-10)
* gperf
* libssl-dev (WITH_SSL)
* libc-ares-dev (WITH_C_ARES)
* libasio-dev
* libboost-all-dev
* libdb++-dev
* libsrtp2-dev
* libgeoip-dev (USE_MAXMIND_GEOIP)
* libpopt-dev (USE_POPT)
* libcppunit-dev (BUILD_TFM)
* libnetxx-dev (BUILD_TFM)
* libqpid-proton-cpp12-dev (BUILD_QPID_PROTON)
* sox (REGENERATE_MEDIA_SAMPLES)
* xxd (REGENERATE_MEDIA_SAMPLES)

### Optional Packages
* default-libmysqlclient-dev (USE_MYSQL)
* libfmt-dev (USE_FMT)
* libgloox-dev (BUILD_ICHAT_GW)
* libgstreamermm-1.0-dev (USE_GSTREAMER)

* libwebsocketpp-dev (USE_KURENTO)
* libxerces-c-dev
* perl
* python3-cxx-dev (BUILD_PYTHON)
* python3-dev (BUILD_PYTHON)


## Building on Windows Systems

### Generating Visual Studio solution and project files

Navigate to git root folder where top level CMakeLists.txt file is.
```
> cmake .
```
Open resiprocate.sln in visual studio:  Build -> Build Solution

If you want to run the unit tests, then right click on the RUN_TESTS project and Build it.

To build recon with sipXtapi media support you need to do the following:
* Clone sipXtapi github repo to same folder as level as you have closed resiprocate github repo.  **The root folder name MUST be: sipXtapi**.
* Run cmake in the resiprocate cloned folder with the following argument:
```
Required structure
<basedir>/<resipclonedirname> (contains resip git clone)
<basedir>/sipXtapi (contains sipXtapi git clone)

> cd <basedir>
> git clone https://github.com/sipXtapi/sipXtapi.git sipXtapi
> cd ../<resipclonedirname>
> cmake -DUSE_SIPXTAPI=ON .
```


### Using Ninja via Visual Studio
* Open the resiprocate folder by using Visual Studio Open Folder feature
* Use CMake GUI for changing CMake build settings and options: Project->CMake Settings for resiprocate
* Build -> Build All

> WARNING: You must not enable sipXtapi(recon) if you are using Ninja, since Ninja won't integrate nicely
> with sipXtapi's linked VS project and solution builds.  For sipXtapi(recon) use the above instructions to generate 
> Visual Studio solution and project files for resip.  We may address this short coming in the future.


## Configuration Flags

CMake "cached" variables are used to specify options such as whether c-ares
should be used or not. You can get the list with:

```
$ cmake -LH
```

You can set them on the command line like:

```
$ cmake -DWITH_C_ARES=true .
```

# Future Considerations

## Installation Packages

CMake supports rpm/deb?/NSIS to build installable packages using CPack. If this
built-in support can not be used we could always specify internal build targets
that will run external commands to package the appropriate bundle depending on
the platform.
